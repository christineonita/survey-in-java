# Things to do before I submit #

## HW2 part B notes ##

- [ ] Remember to implement Serializable for every class except main and include their serialVersionUid
- [ ] Surveys donâ€™t have correct answers
- [ ] Do not hard code file separators
- [ ] Take care of user input being alphabetical (or not an integer) when I require an integer
- [ ] Update README?
- [ ] Allow user to set limit (Sean said they should not exceed Integer.MAX_VALUE and throw an error
  if it does) for:
    - number of choices for multiple choice
    - short answer question length
- [ ] Run intelliJ code quality before i submit
- [ ] Before you submit part B make sure to provide us with a sample survey containing all types of
  questions. If you don't provide us the sample survey your submission will be returned with a 0 and
  you will be asked to fix it with a late penalty.
