# Things to do before I submit #

## Hw2 part B notes ##

- [ ] Refer to this:
    - Suppose the user selects createSurvey option, enters 5 questions, and then selects option 7 to
      go back to the previous menu. In that case, can we assume that the user has finished creating the
      survey, set the current survey to null, and automatically save it? Or does the user explicitly
      need to indicate that they want to save the survey before we save it?
- [ ] Surveys donâ€™t have correct answers
- [ ] Take care of user input being alphabetical (or not an integer) when I require an integer
- [ ] Update README?
- [ ] Before you submit part B make sure to provide us with a sample survey containing all types of questions. If you
  don't provide us the sample survey your submission will be returned with a 0 and you will be asked to fix it with a
  late penalty.
